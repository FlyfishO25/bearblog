			Bear's relative cost is great when compared to stringing together disparate services.
			<br>
			<br>
			Privacy respecting analytics comes at a premium of <a href="https://usefathom.com/pricing" target="_blank">$14/mo</a>, and hosting and image hosting can cost upwards of <a href="https://www.digitalocean.com/pricing/droplets" target="_blank">$5/mo</a> a piece.
			Overall a custom built blog can cost upwards of $24/mo.
			<br>
			<br>
			Bear integrates all of these services. You don't even have to buy themes separately. 
			<br>
			<br>
			Even when compared to other blogging platforms such as Ghost <a href="https://ghost.org/pricing/" target="_blank">($9/mo)</a> and Weebly <a href="https://www.weebly.com/za/pricing" target="_blank">($12/mo without ads)</a>, Bear comes in as being faster and more affordable.
			You could choose Wordpress <a href="https://wordpress.com/pricing/" target="_blank">($4/mo)</a>, but who in their right mind wants to use Wordpress?
			<br>
			<br>
			Most importantly, you'll be supporting the small, fast internet, and a blogging platform built to last forever.
