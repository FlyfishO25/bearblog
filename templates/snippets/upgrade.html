	Most “free” websites subsist by displaying ads or selling user data.
	That, however, would be against the spirit of the Bear project.
	<br>
	In order to keep the servers running and the coffee hot I've decided to charge
	for the most resource-intensive parts of the project:
	<ul>
		<li>Custom domains (due to the amount of my time they require)</li>
		<li>Image uploading (due to the cost of hosting images)</li>
		<li>Beta features (since, well, they aren't ready yet)</li>
	</ul>
