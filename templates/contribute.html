<h2>Hey, Herman here  ʕ •ᴥ•ʔゝ</h2>
<p>
	Most “free” websites subsist by displaying ads or selling user data.
	That, however, would be against the spirit of the Bear project.
	<br>
	In order to keep the servers running and the coffee hot, I've decided to charge
	for the most resource-intensive parts of the project:
	<ul>
		<li>Custom domains (this is time-consuming)</li>
		<li>Image uploading (due to the cost of hosting images)</li>
		<li>Email subscriber lists (since it gets complicated)</li>
		<li>Beta features (since they aren't ready yet)</li>
	</ul>
</p>
<p>
	<b>
		You can upgrade for $29, flat on your <a href="/dashboard/upgrade/">Bear dashboard</a>. 
	</b>
</p>

	You can see where how much money Bear makes, and where those funds are spent <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/HermanMartinus/bearblog/wiki/Contributions">here</a>.

<h3>Help Bear keep the internet awesome!  \ʕ•ᴥ•ʔ/</h2>
