<h2>Hey, Herman here  ʕ •ᴥ•ʔゝ</h2>
<p>
	Most “free” websites subsist by displaying ads or selling user data.
	That, however, would be against the spirit of the Bear project.
	<br>
	In order to keep the servers running and the coffee hot I've decided to charge
	for the most resource-intensive parts of the project:
	<ul>
		<li>Custom domains (due to the amount of my time they require)</li>
		<li>Image uploading (due to the cost of hosting images)</li>
		<li>Beta features (since, well, they aren't ready yet)</li>
	</ul>
</p>
<p>
	<b>You can <a href="#">upgrade for $29 per year</a>.</b>
</p>
<p>
	You can see where how much money Bear makes, and where those funds are spent <a href="#">here</a>.
</p>
<h3>Help Bear keep the internet awesome!  \ʕ•ᴥ•ʔ/</h2>
