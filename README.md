## Can Bear Blog be self-hosted? 
Bear Blog has been built as a platform and not as an indiviual blog system.
It is more like Medium than Jekyll. Due to this it currently isn't possible to self-host Bear Blog as an individual blog.

There is currently a [Bear Blog Hugo theme](https://github.com/janraasch/hugo-bearblog) available built by [Jan Raasch](https://www.janraasch.com/), and a self-hosted version ([Polar Bear Blog](https://github.com/josephspurrier/polarbearblog)) written in Go and hosted on the serverless [Google Cloud Run](https://cloud.google.com/run) architecture by [Joseph Spurrier](https://www.josephspurrier.com).
